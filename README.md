## 1. Status Reports

## Status Report To-Do List (The Bad News)

The To-Do List app does not have a functional memory beyond local storage. Therefore when the browser refreshes or closes, any tasks are deleted. This needs to be on the target list for the next sprint.

## Status Report To-Do List (The Good News)

The To-Do list app has a pleasing, minimalist feel that is consistent throughout. 

Functions work as advertised: Tasks can be entered, edited, struck through, and deleted. 

## 2. Test Summary Report

 ## Test Summary
 App works as advertised
 
 ## Do I feel qualified to test an application?
 Yes, so long as automation isn't called for. I can manually test given at least some guidance about what expected functions are.
 
 ## Do I feel confident reporting a defect?
 Yes, I think given the bounds stated above I can find and accurately describe defects so that other people can reproduce them.
 
## Waterfall vs Agile
|Waterfall Pros|Cons|Agile Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|---|
|Methodical|Inflexible|Flexible|Unpredictable|
|Sequential|Hard to fix|Iterative|Slower if requirements are fixed|
|Predictable|Hard to work in parallel|Can work in parallel|Can result in linked blocks|
|Faster where requirements are fixed|Can result in linear blocks|Not sequential|Less directed|
